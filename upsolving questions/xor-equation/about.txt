XOR Equation

https://www.codechef.com/NOV21B/problems/XOREQN


Bitwise XOR of multiple bits
- 0 if number of 1's are even
- 1 if number of 1's are odd

N = no. of elements is odd, means that if odd no. of 0s (bits) then even no. of 1s (bits)& vice versa

to flip a bit, we add 1 to it. 
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 0 (carry 1)

Algo:-

XOR all given nos. = ans
if i th bit of ans is set, then it contains odd number of 1s
for(0-63)
{
if ith bit is set, we will add 1 to that ith bit ie left shift 1 by i bits (1<<i)
// next prob is to manage the carryovers
}
